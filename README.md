The shopware CLI tools are your console helpers for all kind of Shopware tasks. They will allow you to:

 * setup Shopware from VCS
 * setup Shopware from a release tag
 * create Shopware plugins
 * define a bunch of plugin repositories you use
 * install plugins from the repositories and activate them in shopware
 * zip plugins in the way the Shopware store or the Shopware plugin manager expect it to be

The shopware CLI tools come with a slim extension interface, so you can extend it for your needs.

This is an **early development preview** - so don't expect it to be stable. Please wait for a 1.0.0 stable release before using this tools for production deployments

 Pull requests are very welcome as well as ideas for possible extensions.

# Support

Use at your own risk, there is no support for this tools.

# Install

Generally we recommend to use the sw.phar release files, you can download them to e.g. ~/bin/sw and add this directory to the $PATH of your local user (download current build from http://shopwarelabs.github.io/sw-cli-tools/).

If you want to use the development version of sw-cli-tools, you should checkout the repository and run `composer install` to download all dependencies

## Requirements ###
On your system at least the following packages needs to be available.

 * openjdk-7-jre-headless
 * ant
 * git
 * curl
 * php7-curl
 * If you want to use coloring you should enable php.posix in your php.ini

## Available commands
* sw cache:clear
* sw install:vcs
* sw install:release
* sw plugin:install
* sw plugin:zip:dir
* sw plugin:zip:vcs
* sw plugin:create
* sw generate

## Using the Commands
### sw plugin:install
Will install a plugin from one of the configured repos

Valid options/arguments are:

    --useHttp: use HTTP for checkout if possible (e.g. for VPN, SSH seems to be slow here sometimes)
    --small: Show 3 columns of plugins in a short form
    --shopware-root Shopware root directory
    --branch branch to checkout out
    names1…nameN - names of plugins to install

This command will automatically create a VCS mapping for phpstorm if `.idea/vcs.xml` can be found. You will need
to refresh you config with File->Sychronize (Control+Alt+Y)

### sw plugin:zip:vcs
Will checkout a plugin from VCS and zip it properly for the store

Valid options/arguments are:

    --useHttp: use HTTP for checkout if possible (e.g. for VPN, SSH seems to be slow here sometimes)
    --small: Show 3 columns of plugins in a short form
    --branch branch to checkout out
    names1…nameN - names of plugins to zip

If the plugins contains a file in its root named `.sw-zip-blacklist`, the files/directories described there, will be excluded from zipping

### sw plugin:zip:dir

# Extending the cli tools

## New Extensions

Extensions are created in the `/home/USER/.config/sw-cli-tools/extensions` folder and consist of a vendor folder, the extension folder (with the extension's name) and a `Bootstrap.php` inside the extension folder. Additionally you can provide an own `config.yaml` inside the extension folder which will extend the default `config.yaml`.

The namespace of your extension bootstrap should be `VENDOR_FOLDER\EXTENSION_FOLDER\Bootstrap`.

### Bootstrap
The bootstrap is the main entry point of your extension. If it implements `ContainerAwareExtension`, it will get the container builder
 of the application injected via setContainer. This way the container can be extended by your extension.
Additionally the Bootstrap can implement `ConsoleAwareExtension`. If this is the case, the method "getConsoleCommands" will be
called after creation - please return an array of console command instances here.
Finally the extension will call the `getRepositories` method of extensions implementing `RepositoryAwareInterface`.

### Changing existing components

As you Bootstrap.php is instantiated after the container, you can replace any service of the container

# Paths
The SW cli tools make use of the XDG directory standard. Following directories are used:

    ~/.config/sw-cli-tools: Here the main configuration as well as the extensions are stored
    ~/.cache/sw-cli-tools: Here caches (like repo content) as well as release downloads are cached
    ~/.local/share/sw-cli-tools: Assets the demo data package are stored here

If you changed some of these directories via `XDG` environment variables, those directories are used instead

# Configuration
The configuration of the script is done in `~/.config/sw-cli-tools/config.yaml`.
If the file does not exist on your system, it is created after the first usage of the script.

## Repositories
In order to use commands like `plugin:zip:vcs` the tool needs to know where the source comes from.
For this repositories need to be defined in the `repositories` section of the configuration file.
For now the following repository types are supported:
- GitHub
- Stash
- BitBucket
- SimpleList
- GitLab

This is how an example config could look like:

```yml
repositories:
  GitLab:
    config:
      endpoint: https://gitlab.shopware.com/api/v4/
    repositories:
      Services SW5:
        cache: 86400
        url: groups/92/projects?per_page=100&private_token=your-private-token
        color: red
  GitHub:
    config:
      endpoint: https://api.github.com/search/
    repositories:
      Plugins SW5:
        cache: 86400
        url: repositories?q=org:Shopware5+topic:shopware-plugin
        color: blue
```

# Building sw.phar
For building the release package (`sw.phar`) [box](http://box-project.github.io/box2/) is used.
A new release is build automatically for every push on the master branch by Travis CI (See `bin/deploy.sh`).

# Coding standard
Coding standard for the project is [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md).
Coding standard violations may be detected using php-cs-fixer:

    ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -v --level=psr2 ./src
    ./vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix -v --level=psr2 ./tests

# General hints
## Timeouts
If you are having a slow internet connection and e.g. git checkouts or tasks related to the `ProcessExecutor` fail
with a timeout, you can increase the timeout by setting the environment variable `SW_TIMEOUT`:

    SW_TIMEOUT=500 sw install:vcs
